# thtroyer/noaa-cap-parser

This is going to be a php library built to parse NOAA's CAP format from XML into formats easier to use   

More information about NOAA's CAP format is available [here](http://alerts.weather.gov/).

## Work in progress

This project should be considered unstable and currently a work in progress.  I'll tag versions as they become stable.

Feel free to use the functionality in the mean time.  There is currently an example of how to use the classes as they are set up now (see example.php), but be aware that this usage may change in the future.
